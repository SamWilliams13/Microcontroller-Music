# Microcontroller-Music
This is my A-Level coursework. It makes programs for microcontrollers to play music. More importantly it allows the user to write and play sheet music.

Some top tips:
- If you're looking to do something to a bar, track, note or change timesig/keysig, check the right click context menu.
- Using New File is not necessary but saves you time making changes at the start of the project
- You can use audacity to save your midi output as an mp3
